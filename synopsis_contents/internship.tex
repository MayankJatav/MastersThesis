\chapter{Security Orchestration Automation and Response}

The increasing volume, velocity, and sophistication of cyber threats have made manual incident response insufficient in modern Security Operations Centers (SOCs). As organizations face growing pressure to detect and mitigate attacks in real time, Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms have emerged as a critical solution for scaling security operations and reducing response times. SOAR systems integrate threat intelligence, automate repetitive tasks, and orchestrate incident handling workflows across various tools and teams~\cite{paloalto_soar, ibm_soc}.

This internship project, conducted at Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), focuses on the design and implementation of a custom SOAR platform tailored for real-time cyber incident management. The platform includes core modules such as user authentication, an interactive dashboard, incident analytics, workflow automation, playbook execution, and integration with the MITRE ATT\&CK framework~\cite{mitre_attack}. The goal is to reduce Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) by enabling rapid triage and automated mitigation.

By integrating automation driven decision support with customizable workflows, this SOAR platform empowers security analysts to respond proactively to threats while minimizing fatigue and human error. The project aligns with industry best practices and addresses real-world challenges in enterprise-grade SOC environments.
