\section*{Introduction}

This synopsis presents a dual-track academic and practical contribution carried out as part of the Masterâ€™s thesis. The work is divided into two major components: \textbf{(i) Research Work} focusing on fabric classification using deep learning techniques, and \textbf{(ii) Internship Work} involving the design and development of a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platform during an industrial internship at Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL).

The research work addresses the challenge of accurate fabric identification, which is essential in textile manufacturing, quality assurance, and material categorization. A hybrid deep learning architecture combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) is proposed to enhance the classification of textile fabrics using both macro (RGB) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images. The integration of local and global feature representations enables robust and precise classification across multiple fabric types.

The internship work focuses on the implementation of a custom SOAR system designed to streamline security operations and automate incident response workflows in a Security Operations Center (SOC). The platform comprises key modules such as incident management, workflow orchestration, dashboard analytics, playbook automation, and MITRE ATT\&CK matrix integration. The system was developed to support real-time monitoring, consistent threat handling, and improved operational efficiency.

Together, these two efforts demonstrate the application of advanced engineering principles in solving real-world problems across manufacturing and cybersecurity domains, contributing both to academic research and industry-grade system development.
