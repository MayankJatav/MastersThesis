\chapter{Introduction}

As a part of my Master’s program, I had the opportunity to work on two very different but equally valuable projects—one in research and the other in a practical, industry-based environment. This thesis brings together both experiences in a single document. The first part describes a research project I worked on about the topic Fabric classification using deep learning, and the second part focuses on my internship work in the field of Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR).

Both projects helped me to step out of my comfort zone and exposed me to different aspects of the tech world. The research work taught me how to approach technical problems from a scientific perspective that included reading papers, building models, analyzing results—all while diving deep into machine learning. On the other hand, my internship was much more hands-on, where I got a change to be part of a team developing a cybersecurity tool. This involved writing code for both the backend and frontend, working with APIs, and figuring out how everything ties together in a real world software system.

These experiences were not just about learning new tools or technologies but they also gave me a clear understanding of how AI is being used to solve real problems, whether it’s about predicting threat responses or identifying fabric types using images. I also learned a lot from the people I worked with, who shared their own knowledge and helped me think more critically and practically about building solutions.
