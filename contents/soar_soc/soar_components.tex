\section{SOAR Platform Components}

A Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) solution is commonly made up of many different modules that are useful for primary phases of the incident response life cycle, ranging from ingestion and detection all the way through to analysis, orchestration, and resolution. According to Gartner, SOAR platforms bring together security operations by using playbook-driven automation, workflow orchestration, case management and integration with third-party tools and services~\cite{gartner-siem-soar}. These platforms aim to help SOC analysts by relieving them from repetitive tasks, using consistent responses and documenting their work to ensure auditability.

Commercial standard SOAR solutions, like Splunk SOAR (formerly Phantom) and Palo Alto Cortex XSOAR, provide a myriad of modules for incident handling, playbook execution and third-party integration ~\cite{splunk, paloalto}. For example, Splunk SOAR has a visual playbook builder, a case management tool, over 300 prebuilt integration options (called apps), and a detailed REST API solution for system integration~\cite{splunk}. SimilSimilarly, Palo Alto XSOAR offers integrated case and incident visibility, MITRE ATT\&CK based incident tagging and a marketplace for streamlined extensibility ~\cite{paloalto}. Open-source options, including Shuffle, also offer many capabilities, as well as lightweight, easy-to-use visual automation experiences with pluggable REST actions and community built workflows~\cite{techtarget}.

Although there are some minor differences (in the details) on how SOAR will be implemented, the vast majority of SOAR tools leverage a modular architecture composed of reusable components. Often times these components include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Authentication and User Management:} The authentication and user management component provides authentication, access management and user provisioning. In enterprise SOAR platforms this module is often integrated with SSO, LDAP, or SAML identity providers for central identity management.
    
    \item \textbf{Dashboard and Analytics:} The dashboard and analytics component provides users with a single pane of glass that illustrates trends in incidents or use metrics that can be displayed in charts or graphs, such as pie charts, bar charts, and time series visuals. Dashboards are used by SOC managers when they need assistance in planning and operational oversight~\cite{paloalto}.

    \item \textbf{Incident Management:} The incident management component is the central module used for gathering, reviewing and taking action on alerts generated from SIEM, threat intelligence feeds, or manual sources. Incidents will often contain metadata such as source IPs, attack vectors, severity level, and mappings to the MITRE ATT\&CK framework.

    \item \textbf{Integrations:} The integrations component refers to the ability to integrate with external security and IT tools (e.g., firewalls, EDRs, ticketing systems, threat intel platforms). Integrations are often expressed as “apps” or “connectors” or something similar that plug into the SOAR tool and enable an action like, for example, the ability to send an action to a ticketing system through a REST API, which can be an example of bi-directional communication and orchestration~\cite{techtarget}.

    \item \textbf{Playbooks:} Use a flow-based definition of the logic for an automated response. Playbooks can be triggered by the type of incident or rules. Playbooks allow executing actions, including notified and enrichment of information, containment, and notifications within a sequence. Playbooks can ensure consistency and repeatability in incident handling~\cite{splunk, paloalto}.

    \item \textbf{Workflow Engine:} Provides a visual or low-code interface allowing actions and conditions to be linked in an executable sequence. Some SOAR platforms (i.e., Shuffle) allow workflows to be created with drag and drop actions in place to offer better usability with lower code reliance~\cite{techtarget}.

    \item \textbf{Case Management and Audit Trails:} Allow analysts to monitor the situation, document their decisions, and maintain, full auditability of their response (potentially also fulfill compliance/classification requirements), and for use in a post-mortem analysis. Important in restricted sectors (finance and defence).

    \item \textbf{MITRE ATT\&CK Integration:} A large majority of modern SOAR platforms are now incorporating the MITRE ATT\&CK framework, which provides categorization of incidents based on tactics and techniques. This helps with the strategic mapping of threats, and helps incidents be correlated and prioritized for actions taken~\cite{mitre}.
\end{itemize}

All of these elements are essential to automatically manage the incident lifecycle, reduce analyst fatigue, and decrease the mean time to respond (MTTR). Commercial platforms provide advanced implementations, but the custom SOAR solutions can be configured to satisfy distinct organizational and regulatory considerations, such as air-gapped environments in national defense infrastructures.

\subsection{User Authentication}

The user authentication implemented with the help of \textbf{Login and Signup} module is the entry point into the SOAR platform, responsible for identifying users and managing their access rights. The operations that are undertaken in the SOAR environment are important and sensitive in nature (e.g. accessing threat intelligence, executing playbooks, incident responses); thus, the user authentication module must be secure and possess functionality that relates to user management.

In the implemented system, users register with unique username and password that are stored securely in the backend database. Passwords are never written in plain text. When a user registers, their password will be hashed with a cryptographic hash function (like SHA-256 or bcrypt). When a user logs in, the login password is securely compared to the entries in the database (using secure comparison) to ensure that it is not vulnerable to timing attacks.

The authentication mechanism is stateless and uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or session cookies to persist the user state, post-login. After authentication, the user receives a token that must be produced with future APIs. This token based implementation is standard practice in the field, due to the scalability benefits and secure sessions~\cite{paloalto, techtarget}.

Currently, the implementation only supports single-role authentication, but the architecture allows for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in the future. This is useful when establishing role-based access of specialist teams to certain modules, like, incident response, playbook management, and integrations for operational security and accountability. 

In comparison, enterprise-grade SOAR platforms like Splunk SOAR, and Palo Alto (XSOAR) provide advanced authentication features, including Single Sign-On (SSO), integration to the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), and multi-factor authentication (MFA)~\cite{splunk, paloalto}. While these features are important to large organizations, lightweight and locally-hosted SOAR solutions may have uuid or token based credentials to provide an easier way of managing access to the solution, especially when handling deployed solutions in air gapped and restricted environments, like defense organizations.

In summary, the Login/Signup module in the developed SOAR system provides both a secure and extensible platform for user authentication. It ensures that only authorized users have access to sensitive features in the system. The module is modular and may allow for future improvements, such as access auditing, multi-factor authentication (MFA), or integration with national identity providers.

\subsection{Dashboard}

The \textbf{Dashboard} acts as the single visualization platform of SOAR providing SOC analysts and administrators with the capability to view the near real-time status of the security  environment. The Dashboard reduces the amount of span of control, identifying the situation  regarding ongoing incidents, trends with incidents over time, and response metrics.  Dashboards are effective for operational situational awareness, strategic planning and post-event analysis.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/splunk_soar_dashboard.jpg}
    \caption[Example of a Splunk SOAR dashboard]{Example of a Splunk SOAR dashboard. Such dashboards provide SOC teams with real-time visibility into security operations and response effectiveness.}
    \label{fig:splunk-soar-dashboard}
\end{figure}

In the implemented SOAR system, the dashboard consists of multiple interactive visual components:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{Pie Charts:} Represent incident breaks down by severity (e.g., low, medium, high, critical) and status (e.g., open, in-progress, mitigated, closed). 
    \item \textbf{Stacked Area Chart:} Demonstrates the time-based trend of incidents in each category, allowing for incidences of peaks and valleys in reporting over time. 
    \item \textbf{Bar Graph:} It displays the top attack types or event categories based on frequency, that helps in prioritizing the detection rules and playbook tuning.
    \item \textbf{Line Graph:} Displays overall incident volume over time; useful for detecting recurring patterns that signify a threat or an anomaly in network behavior.
    \item \textbf{Mitigated Incidents Table:} A table describing resolved incidents over time.  Each incident is listed with a timestamp, severity of the incident, method of mitigation, and notes from analyst.
\end{itemize}

The visualizations are generated dynamically from the backend database so that the SOC team has the most current information. As new front-end technologies allow for filtering, hovering on the graphics, and drill-down capabilities, they make these more accessible for Tier 1 analysts and SOC managers.

By comparison, enterprise-grade SOAR platforms like \textbf{Splunk SOAR} and \textbf{Palo Alto} Cortex XSOAR also feature strong dashboard modules. The Splunk SOAR dashboard includes customizable widgets, that show the automation coverage, stats on playbook executions, case resolution times, and breakdown of type of threat~\cite{splunk}. XSOAR provides executive summary views, threat intelligence overlays, SLA view and integrates with MITRE ATT\&CK matrix visualizations~\cite{paloalto}. These features assist high-level directors with monitoring the security posture, compliance compliance, and operational performance at scale.

Open-source platforms like \textbf{Shuffle} present a more lightweight example where the dashboard provides basic content and a within the dashboard presents execution success rates, most recent runs, and tasks that have failed~\cite{techtarget}. In comparison to commercial platforms mentioned earlier, it is minimal, but can be extended using third-party tools such as Grafana or Kibana for increased visibility.

The inclusion of a comprehensive dashboard module is an important function for supporting data-driven incident response. By implementing a dashboard, the SOC can monitor KPIs such as Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Respond (MTTR). It can also identify bottlenecks, repeatable alerts, and areas of playbook coverage inadequacies. A high-quality incident response dashboard converts data into useful, actionable insight that can help the SOC to improve operational maturity through continuous improvement.

\subsection{Incidents}

The Incidents module is the operation core of the SOAR platform, and the direct consumer of alerts received directly from upstream systems like a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. The alerts are correlated and determined to be actionable; they are stored as incidents in the incident management system where analysts can open and investigate incidents interactively through structured interfaces and automated workflows.

The SOAR system that has been implemented displays incidents in an interactive and filterable table. Each row describes a single incident, that may contain the following metadata fields:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{Timestamp:} The time at which the incident was triggered.
    \item \textbf{Attack Type:} Categorization based on the detected behavior (e.g., brute-force, phishing, malware).
    \item \textbf{Severity:} A rating (e.g., low, medium, high, critical) based on correlation rules or risk score.
    \item \textbf{Source and Destination IPs/Hosts:} Network location of the event.
    \item \textbf{Associated MITRE Technique IDs:} Tactic and technique labels for threat classification.
    \item \textbf{Status:} Indicates whether the incident is open, in progress, resolved, or closed.
\end{itemize}

Users can use filters to select which incidents they want to view by attack type, status, or severity and take response actions from the interface itself. A unique feature of this platform is that it allows both manual and AI-assisted updates to incident status. Analysts have the option to either take manual actions, such as marking an incident as mitigated, or request mitigation recommendations stepped out by a selected ML model, which recommends based on past resolutions. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/xsoar_incidents.png}
    \caption[Incident management interface in Palo Alto Cortex XSOAR]{Incident management interface in Palo Alto Cortex XSOAR. The interface provides analysts with a comprehensive view of incidents, including filtering, status updates, and detailed metadata for each alert.}
    \label{fig:xsoar-incidents}
\end{figure}

This AI-assisted mitigation capability surpasses the present capabilities of many commercial SOAR platforms, where features include AI-ML to some extent, or is at least limited as an external integration; examples include Splunk SOAR, which provides advanced correlation and playbook automation, but does not inherently provides for ML model selection for selecting self-learned response, without having integrated third-party platforms~\cite{splunk}; and Cortex XSOAR provides for data enrichment and contextual awareness, but with its machine learning features, relies on Palo Alto’s Threat Intelligence, or other external resources~\cite{paloalto}.

Open-source SOAR tools such as Shuffle provide a rather coarse incident ingestion and display process from webhook integrations, but without native enrichment, severity-scoring, or AI-assisted resolution workflows~\cite{techtarget}. The presented SOAR system thus bridges this gap by offering native ML model selection for predictive mitigation, making it suitable for organizations that want to experiment with or deploy AI-driven security automation.

In conclusion, the incident module in the custom SOAR platform not only visualizes threat data but actively integrates with intelligence, analytics, and automation components. Its hybrid approach—combining analyst control with AI support—ensures scalability, consistency, and reduced mean time to respond (MTTR) in SOC operations.

\subsection{Integrations}

The Integrations module is the building block of any SOAR platform allowing it to connect and orchestrate a diverse set of cyber security tools and systems within an ecosystem. It enables the platform to communicate with other vendor tools/resources (i.e. firewall, EPP/EDR, threat intelligence feeds, vulnerability scanners, cloud providers, ticketing systems, etc.) using standardized API interfaces. This connectivity is important to allow an automated action to be performed during the execution of a playbook or as part of manual analyst workflow. 

In the implemented SOAR platform, integrations are managed through a interface that provides the option of creating, modifying and deleting Apps and Actions:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{App:} Represents an internal or external service or tool. Each app in the platform has fields for name, description, and API token.
    \item \textbf{Action:} Represents a specific action that can be performed by the app. Each action has fields for action name, HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and the associated API endpoint URL.
\end{itemize}

The defined actions allow non-technical users to register integrations and use them across various workflows without writing code. Once configured, the actions can either be triggered via playbooks, or performed manually from the incident module. For example, a configured VirusTotal app may have actions like ‘scan\_url‘, ‘check\_hash‘, or ‘get\_report‘, and can be invoked during the threat enrichment stage.

Compared to commercial solutions, this modular app-action model is aligned with industry best practices. Splunk SOAR, for instance, provides over 300 built-in integrations known as “apps,” each containing a set of pre-configured actions. These can be used in visual playbooks and extended via custom Python scripting~\cite{splunk}. Similarly, Cortex XSOAR organizes integrations into packs that include playbook tasks, data models, and API-based connectors~\cite{paloalto}. It also supports live configuration from the user interface and centralized credential management.

Open-source platforms such as Shuffle follow a comparable model by offering REST-based integrations that can be created or imported from community repositories. Shuffle also allows users to write lightweight custom apps in Python or JavaScript, which are run in sandboxed Docker containers ~\cite{techtarget}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/shuffle_soar_apps.png}
    \caption[[Example of the integrations (apps) interface in Shuffle SOAR]]{Example of the integrations (apps) interface in Shuffle SOAR. Users can visually manage and configure third-party integrations and their actions through a web-based UI.}
    \label{fig:shuffle-soar-apps}
\end{figure}

The integrations module not only increases automation, but provides scalability and modularity in security operations. Each external service can be treated as a pluggable app with configurable actions, so the platform follows the principles of microservices, giving future orchestrations extensibility.

\subsection{Playbooks}

The \textbf{Playbooks} module is the automation engine of the SOAR platform, enabling structured and repeatable responses to detected security incidents. A playbook is a predefined sequence of steps—both automated and manual—that governs how an incident should be investigated and remediated. Playbooks are essential for ensuring consistency, reducing analyst fatigue, and minimizing human error in high-volume environments.

In the implemented SOAR system, playbooks are defined, managed, and executed via an intuitive user interface. The module supports the following key features:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{Add/Edit/Delete Playbook:} Users can create new playbooks or modify existing ones to align with updated procedures, threat types, or compliance requirements.
    
    \item \textbf{MITRE ATT\&CK Association:} Each playbook can be linked to one or more MITRE ATT\&CK Technique IDs. When an incoming incident matches a technique identifier, the corresponding playbook is automatically triggered. This enables context-aware, tactic-specific response automation~\cite{mitre}.
    
    \item \textbf{Workflow Linking:} Playbooks are tied to workflows—graphical representations of the actions and conditions to be executed in sequence. This decouples the logical decision-making layer (playbooks) from the execution engine (workflow), promoting reuse and flexibility.
\end{itemize}

The logic defined within a playbook may include various response actions, such as:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item Enriching indicators using threat intelligence sources (e.g., WHOIS, VirusTotal).
    \item Blocking malicious IPs or URLs using integrations with firewalls or web gateways.
    \item Isolating endpoints using EDR tools.
    \item Creating tickets or notifications via ticketing systems or email services.
\end{itemize}

Each step can include conditions, triggers, and optional human approvals, allowing playbooks to function in fully automated or semi-automated modes.

This implementation follows the design philosophy of enterprise-grade SOAR platforms. For instance, \textbf{Splunk SOAR} allows users to build playbooks using a visual editor, combining decision blocks, automation tasks, and manual inputs~\cite{splunk}. Playbooks in Splunk SOAR are Python-based under the hood but are abstracted for low-code use. \textbf{Palo Alto Cortex XSOAR} extends this concept with its drag-and-drop playbook editor and built-in task types, enabling advanced branching logic and error handling~\cite{paloalto}.

Open-source SOAR platforms such as \textbf{Shuffle} also provide playbook editors with visual flow-based design. However, they are typically limited in features such as conditional branching, versioning, and advanced user inputs~\cite{techtarget}. While sufficient for basic automation, they may require custom scripting for more complex response procedures.

A unique aspect of the custom SOAR platform presented in this work is its ability to associate playbooks with ATT\&CK techniques directly within the interface, thereby enabling seamless tactic-level incident automation. This facilitates faster and more accurate responses, especially in SOC environments aligned with the MITRE ATT\&CK framework for threat modeling and incident classification.

Overall, the playbook module is instrumental in operationalizing security response strategies. It encapsulates institutional knowledge, codifies best practices, and ensures that each incident is handled with appropriate urgency and consistency.

\subsection{Workflows}

The \textbf{Workflow} module acts as the execution engine of the SOAR platform, responsible for carrying out the actions defined within playbooks. While playbooks provide the logical structure and decision-making rules for incident response, workflows are the operational blueprints that determine how tasks are executed in sequence—visually represented as directed graphs composed of nodes (apps/actions) and edges (transitions).

In the developed SOAR platform, workflows are created and managed using a visual, drag-and-drop interface. Key features of the module include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Create/Edit/Delete Workflows:} Users can construct workflows from scratch or modify existing ones using a canvas-based editor.
    
    \item \textbf{Node-Based Design:} Each node represents an app configured via the Integrations module. Nodes may expose one or more actions (e.g., scan file, block IP, query URL).
    
    \item \textbf{Drawable Edges:} Nodes are connected using directional edges to define the order of execution. Conditional routing and branching logic can be visually represented by linking multiple nodes based on success, failure, or other states.
    
    \item \textbf{Execution List:} A log of previously executed workflows is maintained, including execution status, incident ID, trigger source, timestamps, and logs for each step.
\end{itemize}

This approach provides SOC analysts with a low-code environment to model complex incident response logic visually, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users. Analysts can reuse workflows across different playbooks, promoting modularity and standardization in the response process.

The architecture of the workflow module is conceptually similar to what is offered by commercial SOAR platforms. For example, \textbf{Splunk SOAR} includes a visual playbook editor where each block represents a discrete action or condition, forming a directed flowchart~\cite{splunk}. Actions can be executed in sequence or in parallel, with support for user prompts, decision gates, and failure handling.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/shuffle_soar_workflow.png}
        \caption[Example of a workflow editor in Shuffle SOAR]{Example of a workflow editor in Shuffle SOAR. The visual interface allows users to design and manage automated response workflows by connecting integration actions and defining execution logic.}
    \label{fig:shuffle-soar-workflow}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Palo Alto Cortex XSOAR} extends this paradigm by offering sophisticated conditional flows, loops, exception management, and variable sharing across tasks~\cite{paloalto}. Its workflow engine supports both automation tasks and human-in-the-loop interactions (e.g., approval requests), enabling hybrid response models.

Open-source SOAR platforms such as \textbf{Shuffle} are also designed around workflow automation, with a visual interface that allows drag-and-drop placement of integration actions, conditional paths, and data variables~\cite{techtarget}. However, Shuffle workflows typically focus on simplicity and ease of scripting, with fewer built-in safeguards or error-handling mechanisms compared to enterprise-grade systems.

A distinctive aspect of the workflow module in the custom SOAR platform is its tight coupling with the Integrations and Playbook modules. Users can dynamically select app actions while building workflows, and these workflows can be associated with specific playbooks tied to MITRE ATT\&CK techniques. This modularity allows for flexible reuse, rapid prototyping, and seamless expansion as new integrations and response use cases are added.

Overall, the workflow module transforms logical response strategies into executable sequences, providing the backbone for effective security automation in the SOAR architecture. It bridges the gap between decision logic and operational execution, ensuring that incident handling is both efficient and auditable.

\subsection{MITRE ATT\&CK Module}

The \textbf{MITRE ATT\&CK} (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) module integrates the widely adopted threat modeling framework into the SOAR platform to enhance contextual awareness, incident classification, and strategic response alignment. ATT\&CK provides a structured knowledge base of adversary behaviors, organized into tactics (goals) and techniques (methods), allowing SOC teams to understand the “why” and “how” behind detected threats~\cite{mitre}.

In the developed SOAR system, the MITRE ATT\&CK module offers a visually interactive matrix interface modeled after the official ATT\&CK Enterprise Matrix. Its key features include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Technique-Based Filtering:} Each cell in the matrix corresponds to a specific ATT\&CK technique. Clicking on a cell filters and displays the list of incidents in the system that are mapped to that technique, providing quick threat attribution.
    
    \item \textbf{Heatmap Visualization:} A color-coded heatmap overlays the matrix based on the number of incidents associated with each technique. Colors range from white (no incidents) to blue (low frequency) to red (high frequency), visually highlighting the most frequently observed techniques within the environment.
    
    \item \textbf{Technique-Incident Association:} During incident ingestion, techniques can be mapped automatically or manually, linking each incident to its corresponding ATT\&CK entries. This classification is leveraged by playbooks to determine which workflows to trigger.
\end{itemize}

The integration of MITRE ATT\&CK in SOAR platforms serves multiple purposes: it enhances situational awareness, supports threat hunting, and allows for better alignment of detection and response strategies with real-world adversary tactics. Furthermore, it provides a foundation for behavioral analytics, red teaming, and compliance reporting.

Commercial SOAR solutions such as \textbf{Palo Alto Cortex XSOAR} offer built-in support for ATT\&CK. Incidents can be tagged with tactics and techniques, and dashboard modules allow visualization of coverage and attack surface exposure~\cite{paloalto}. XSOAR also supports threat intel enrichment using ATT\&CK metadata and enables filtering and reporting based on technique distributions.

\textbf{Splunk SOAR} does not natively provide a full ATT\&CK matrix interface, but integrations with the Splunk Security Essentials app or external visualizations (e.g., MITRE ATT\&CK Navigator) allow SOCs to map playbooks and detections to tactics and techniques~\cite{splunk}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/mitre_att&ck_matrix.png}
    \caption[Interactive MITRE ATT\&CK matrix]{Interactive MITRE ATT\&CK matrix. The matrix enables analysts to visualize incident distribution across tactics and techniques, supporting rapid threat attribution and response prioritization.}
    \label{fig:mitre-attck-matrix}
\end{figure}

Open-source platforms such as \textbf{Shuffle} generally do not include a dedicated ATT\&CK interface out-of-the-box, though users can manually tag incidents and build custom visualizations using third-party tools like ATT\&CK Navigator, Kibana, or D3.js-based dashboards~\cite{techtarget}.

The custom SOAR platform presented here integrates ATT\&CK directly into its core, offering a native visual matrix tightly coupled with incident metadata and playbook execution. By embedding this visualization, analysts gain immediate insight into threat patterns and can prioritize response actions based on frequently exploited techniques. This also supports proactive defense strategies, such as identifying unmonitored or under-covered techniques and adapting detection rules accordingly.

Overall, the MITRE ATT\&CK module elevates the strategic value of the SOAR platform, enabling structured threat intelligence application, better prioritization, and improved operational alignment with adversary behaviors.
